# Haptic-viewer
#A Terminal Based APP to download from reddit by subreddit. Coded in python by a newer programmer to api's.

#Welcome: $User,
#This program is a was for reddit users to view subreddits from a terminal. (NO WEB-BROWSER NEEDED)
#This was a learning project codenamed "Haptic-Viewer", This was done using the Reddit API known as 'PRAW'.
#I do not own praw, and while it is an amazing product, I am only using it in read mode to avoid complicated set up.

#Flaws:
#Cannot post content
#Cannot view comments
#Cannot see who posted said content

#Set up;
#You need to create a bot from reddit and link it to your account. Look up "creating a reddit bot for engineers' if you do not know how to do this.
#Go to the file cred.py and input the informations to the tabs provided. 
#then you can run the program.

#How to use:
#run the program "python3 Haptic_go.py";
#That will run the program and ask you two questions;

#What subreddit do you want to browse? - anything from funny to pictures (DO NOT ADD r/)
#How many inputs do you want? - input the amount of posts you would like to receive from said subreddit

#If you have anyquestions post them somewhere, If I dont see them someone else will.
